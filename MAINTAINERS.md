# MAINTAINERS
[The objective of the InfraDDS initiative](https://github.com/InfraDDS/README.md) is to foster a community-driven, standards-based open ecosystem for next-generation architectures and frameworks built on [Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure technology](https://github.com/InfraDDS/README.md/blob/main/SPEC.md).

InfraDDS maintainers do the work of keeping the project running.

Maintainers do the following things in support of InfraDDS projects:

- Writing code for new features
- Writing code to fix bugs
- Opening bug reports
- Triaging bug reports
- Closing bug reports
- Reviewing pull requests
- Merging pull requests from contributors
- Resolving conflict found on pull request reviews
- Proactively dealing with technical debt
- Supporting documentation
- Guiding the projects strategic direction
- In other words, maintainers are involved in day-to-day operations of the project.

# InfraDDS Maintainer Prerequisites
You should understand the [contributing](https://github.com/InfraDDS/composable-dra-driver/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines if you want to become a maintainer.

# InfraDDS Maintainer Groups

We recognize the need to have a few different groups with merge rights. 

With the above in mind, the following three groups of maintainers exist inside of InfraDDS:

- [Dynamic Device Scaler](https://github.com/InfraDDS/dynamic-device-scaler)
- [Composable Resources Operator](https://github.com/InfraDDS/composable-resource-operator)
- InfraDDS-maintainers All InfraDDS repositories

This allows us to help merge policy based things in the InfraDDS repository. 

Finally, note that having merge rights to any InfraDDS repo is a job and not a privilege. If people are not reviewing PRs in a meaningful way, they stand to lose merge rights, per the policy found below.

# InfraDDS Maintainer Grant/Revocation Policy

An InfraDDS maintainer is a participant in InfraDDS who has the ability to merge pull requests directly into main branch on InfraDDS repositories. This ability grants the maintainers the ability to affect the progress of the InfraDDS project in a way non-maintainers cannot. Being an InfraDDS maintainer represents a significant level of trust to the broader project. Maintainer rights are not granted lightly, and will be reviewed as necessary to ensure that trust has not been violated.

## Granting Maintainer Rights

Granting maintainer rights will be considered when a candidate has demonstrated the following in their interation with the project:

- Contribution of significant new features to InfraDDS.
  - Submissions are free of obvious defects.
  - Submissions do not require many revisions.
- Consistent and meaningful code reviews of other people's pull requests.
- Helping others in the community via channels such as the mailing list, GitHub. Issues and PRs, and the Slack channels
- The individual should have plans for sustained contribution to the project.

The process to grant someone the maintainer role is simple:
- An existing maintainer nominates someone by sending a message to the maintainers slack channel.
- Existing maintainers discuss the idea of giving the candidate maintainer rights.
- After discussion has ended, existing maintainers will vote on approving the new maintainer.
- To receive maintainership, the candidate must receive a majority of yes votes and zero no votes.
- One final discussion with the candidate happens to ensure the candidate is ready to accept the maintainer role.
- If successful, the candidate is added to the appropriate GitHub group to gain maintainer access, as well as the maintainers Slack channel.

## Revoking Maintainer Rights

There are times when a maintainer will be removed in a peaceful way. For example, the maintainers may decide that someone should not have merge rights due to their lack of git knowledge. In this case, the maintainers can talk to this indvidual and work to revoke their maintainer access.

However, there are times when a maintainer may need to be forcefully removed. When a maintainer acts in a way which is detrimental to the InfraDDS project, it raises a situation which needs to be handled quickly to ensure the long-term success and stability of the project. It is possible the maintainer in question will have their maintainer rights removed. The process for this is as follows:

- Discuss with the individual privately about the concerns. Use email for this, sticking to the facts, and try to reach a resolution on the individuals. behavior. Ensure the individual understands their behavior needs to change.
- Send an email discussing the individual's behavior to the maintainer mailing list. Work to resolve the issue in this forum.
- If necessary, start a thread with maintainers except the individual in question regarding revoking the individuals maintainer rights.
- Each maintainer may vote yes, no, or abstain. Not voting is equivalent to abstain.
- After all votes are collected, to remove the maintainer, the vote must be a 2/3 yes vote in favor of removal.
- Any no votes should document their reasons for not voting to remove the persons maintainership.
- The person proposing revoking maintainer rights sends email to the list announcing the results.
- If the vote to remove is successful, the candidate will be removed from the GitHub group which has merge rights.
- Ideally, the revoked committer peacefully leaves the community. If this is not the case, the maintainers have documented the reason for removal above, and this can be shared with the broader community in support of their decision.
